#DS Project Overview

- I'm planning to predict if emails contains an action (sentences are imperative or not).
- I have Enron Email Dataset and Hillary Client Emails.
- I know that the data has some labelling, but not for imperative sentences.  I am still searching for additional dataset
- I chose this topic because email is a huge pita for me and others, I would like to use machine learning to make it easier to process work emails.
